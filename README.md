# MetricLearning

The Metric Learning (similarity based on a distance metric) field has been around for quite some time with several deep neural networks being predominant in the field. We evalauted these prodominant deep neural networks: Variational Auto-Encoders (VAEs), siamese networks, triplet networks, and variational auto-encoders combined with siamese or triplet networks. 

# VAE
The VAE is a neural network that does not learn any type of distance metric. Instead,the network is a generative model where it learns to create low-dimensional representations
